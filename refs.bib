abstract = "We have studied the effect of Zn on hydrogenation of formate to dioxomethylene on the Cu(111) surface by using a density functional theory-generalized gradient approximation (DFT-GGA)-pseudopotential method. We show that substitutionally adsorbed Zn changes the stability of intermediate states and the activation barrier of the hydrogenation process only slightly. On the other hand, the Zn atom adsorbed on the Cu surface stabilizes all formate, transition state, and dioxomethylene relative to the gas-phase molecules. Our results support a previously proposed reaction scheme that the adsorption state of Zn changes from substitutional to on-surface adsorption during the methanol synthesis."

abstract = "The chemisorption of CO molecules on Pt(111) is studied by first-principles calculations based on the local density functional formalism with a slab model to represent the extended metal surface. We have developed a population analysis scheme which is applicable to calculations with plane wave basis sets. By applying the scheme to COPt(111), the 4$\sigma$ and 1$\pi$ orbitals of CO are found to be completely filled, showing that they do not play a role in the bonding of CO to the surface. On the other hand, the calculated populations of the 5$\sigma$ and 2$\pi$ orbitals indicate that there is substantial 5$\sigma$ donation and 2$\pi$ backdonation, supporting the Blyholder model of CO chemisorption, the validity of which has recently been questioned. These results also suggest that a molecular-orbital based picture such as the Blyholder model is appropriate for describing simply the chemisorption bond, in spite of the fact that the molecular orbitals of CO rehybridize with each other upon adsorption, as has been shown recently by X-ray emission spectroscopy."
