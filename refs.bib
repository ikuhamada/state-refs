abstract = "We have studied the effect of Zn on hydrogenation of formate to dioxomethylene on the Cu(111) surface by using a density functional theory–generalized gradient approximation (DFT–GGA)-pseudopotential method. We show that substitutionally adsorbed Zn changes the stability of intermediate states and the activation barrier of the hydrogenation process only slightly. On the other hand, the Zn atom adsorbed on the Cu surface stabilizes all formate, transition state, and dioxomethylene relative to the gas-phase molecules. Our results support a previously proposed reaction scheme that the adsorption state of Zn changes from substitutional to on-surface adsorption during the methanol synthesis."

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable."

abstract = {The structure and implementation of a new general iterative method for diagonalising large matrices (the 'residual minimisation/direct inversion in the iterative subspace' method of Bendt and Zunger) are described and contrasted with other more commonly used iterative techniques. The method requires the direct diagonalisation of only a small submatrix, does not require the storage of the large matrix and provides eigensolutions to within a prescribed precision in a rapidly convergent iterative procedure. Numerical results for two rather different matrices (a real 50*50 non-diagonally dominant matrix and a complex Hermitian 181*181 matrix corresponding to the pseudopotential band structure of a semiconductor in a plane wave basis set) are used to compare the new method with the competing methods. the new method converges quickly and should be the most efficient for very large matrices in terms both of computation time and central storage requirements; it is quite insensitive to the properties of the matrices used. This technique makes possible efficient solution of a variety of quantum mechanical matrix problems where large basis set expansions are required.}
